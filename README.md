## Planets facts site

I made this planets fact site using React and SASS including CSS GRID & FLEXBOX.

I used useContext to handle the state between components which shows the skills neccesary to pass this project.

Hope you like it!

I got the design from [Frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io) .
